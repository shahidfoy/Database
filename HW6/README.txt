Getting started:
This database project was made using the Wapp stack.
if you would like to run this project on your local computer download the wapp stack here:

this stack will set up a web development environment where you can use PHP and postgreSQL
once the stack is downloaded move the htdocs files provided in this folder into the location where you 
downloaded the wapp stack.  Replace the htdocs file inside the 'apache2/htdocs' with the htdocs provided in this project
also make sure to use the tables created in HW5 to setup the database.
